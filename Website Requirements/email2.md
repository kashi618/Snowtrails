SUBJECT: Improving User Experience - Snowtrails

Dear Mr. Snow,

We are sorry to hear about your visual impairment, but we want to assure you that this does not limit your ability to navigate our website. We have implemented new features to make the site more accessible for visually impaired users.

Here are the changes we have made:
- We have added descriptions to all images, allowing screen readers and similar tools to describe the visuals on the website.
- Descriptions have also been added to all links, so visually impaired users can better understand where each link leads.
- We have reviewed and reformatted various sections of the website, including the headings, subheadings, and paragraphs, to ensure a consistent structure. Proper formatting enhances the experience for screen reader users by making it easier to navigate the content.

Additionally, we have published the website on GitHub Pages. You can check it out [here](https://kashi618.github.io/Snowtrails/Website/HTML). Please let us know if you have any suggestions for further improvements.

As for the website's structure, it contains four pages: Home, Contact, About, and Error.
- Home Page: You are greeted by the SNOWTRAILS sign in white, set against a background photo of Mount Everest. Below the sign, you will find the slogan "EXPECT EXCITING ESCAPES" and a search bar for browsing various mountain and holiday destinations. Beneath that, there are three Polaroid-style images displaying user-uploaded photos of different destinations, along with information such as stay duration and pricing. At the top, a navigation bar provides links to useful pages like Contact and About.
- Contact Page: This page allows customers to leave tips, complaints, or reviews about their holiday experiences. The layout is kept simple, featuring four fields for entering name, email, phone number, and message. An FAQ section below provides answers to common questions.
- About Page: This page shares information about you, your travels, and recommended alpine sports.

If you have any concerns, please feel free to contact us at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Nexus Design Team
