SUBJECT: Improving User Experience - Snowtrails

Dear Mr Snow,
We are sorry to hear that you are blind, however, that is not a problem. We have added more features which makes the 
website more accessible to those who are also visually impared.

First, we have created descriptions for all the images. This means that screen readers and other similar tools can 
be used to describe the images present.

Secondly, we have also added descriptions to all the links present on each page. This lets those who are visually 
impared know what page it is linked to.

Lastly, we have also gone over and reformatted many parts of the website. This includes but is not limited to, correct formatting of headings, sub-headings, and paragraphs. This is to improve the ease of accessing the website, as proper formatting of text can make it easier for screen readers to navigate.

Now for some exciting news, we have published the website to github pages, which you can check here. 
https://kashi618.github.io/Snowtrails/Website/HTML/index.html. Please let us know if any improvments should be made.

If you have any concerns feel free to contact us at your earliest convenience.

Kind Regards,
Nexus Design Team.
