SUBJECT: Improving User Experience - Snowtrails

Dear Mr Snow,
We offer our deepest apologies about our un-informed selves for not knowing you are blind. We have worked meticulously to change the website to be accessible to those like you with visual imparities. We will also include a deep explanation of what the website looks like and includes.

First, we have created descriptions for all the images. This means that screen readers and other similar tools can 
be used to describe the images present.

Secondly, we have also added descriptions to all the links present on each page. This lets those who are visually 
impared know what page it is linked to.

Lastly, we have also gone over and reformatted many parts of the website. This includes but is not limited to, correct formatting of headings, sub-headings, and paragraphs. This is to improve the ease of accessing the website, as proper formatting of text can make it easier for screen readers to navigate.

Now for some exciting news, we have published the website to github pages, which you can check here. 
https://kashi618.github.io/Snowtraivls/Website/HTML/index.html. Please let us know if any improvments should be made.

As for the visuals of the website, there are 4 pages total. The home page, contact page, about page, and the error page.

On the home page, you are first greeted with the SNOWTRAILS sign in white. The background of the website is a photo graph taken of Mount Everest. Under the title sign, there is the slogan "EXPECT EXCITING ESCAPES". Underneath this is a search bar which can be used to browse the many mountains and holiday destinations you can go to. Beneath that, there is a trio of polaroids, depicting user taken photos of various destinations, with with information such as the stay amount and the pricing. At the top of the website, there is a navigation bar containing links to usefull pages, such as the contact and about page.

As for the contacts page, this is where customers can leave tips, complaints, and reviews based on their holiday. We decided to keep this page simple and straight to the point. It has 4 boxes in which the user enters their name, email, phone number, and their query. The FAQ section is also included underneath, containing questions and answers to commonly asked questions. 

The third page is the about page. This age

If you have any concerns feel free to contact us at your earliest convenience.

Kind Regards,
Nexus Design Team.
