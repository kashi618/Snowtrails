SUBJECT: Improving User Experience - Snowtrails

Dear Mr. Snow,

I hope this email finds you well, We have made a redisign to your website to give it a more modern feel and updated the index page to include more information. The contact page also is responsive and functioning.

We have updated the website as per your requests making the website responsive on all devices in three new ways. We have let users know what they have submitted by showing what they entered back to them and have added animations throughout the website to make it more responsive. We have also made the Navigation bar transform into a drop down menu for smaller devices for easier accessibility. Your website should now be responsive and easy to navigate on all devices. 

We have heard your want for a lighhouse report which came out generally good all categories being above 90 except for performance which was only at 58. However we have improved on this and improved the score to be at 81 by editing the size and format of the photos you provided to suit the website more. Although there remains some issues with regards to the photos on the website which affect the performance of the website, I hope you can understand that we have tried out best in improving upon this issue.

We have added both of your requests to your website. We have included your thoughts and opinions on how great blind skateboarders can be in the about section of your website. The new "Get Started" page allows users to book a trip and see what trips are offered showing the details of the Price, Duration, Difficulty, Group Size and if Equipment is provided on the trip. To make this page responsive we have made it so it shows what information is entered into the booking details after it is submitted back to the user letting them know they have booked a trip successfully.

If you would like to explore the new and improved website we have included a link below:
