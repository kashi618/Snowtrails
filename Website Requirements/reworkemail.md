SUBJECT: Improving User Experience - Snowtrails

Dear Mr Snow,
We offer our deepest apologies for our uninformed selves for we had not for known that you are blind. In reference to this we have worked meticulously to change the website to be accessible to those likewise to you with visual imparities. We have also include a detailed description of the website so you can know your product.

To list some of the changes we have done to make the website is accessible:
First, we have created descriptions for all the images. This means that screen readers and other similar tools can be used to describe the images present.

Secondly, we have also added descriptions to all the links present on each page. This lets those who are visually impared know what page it is linked to.

Lastly, we have also gone over and reformatted many parts of the website. This includes but is not limited to, correct formatting of headings, sub-headings, and paragraphs. This is to improve the ease of accessing the website, as proper formatting of text can make it easier for screen readers to navigate.

Now for some exciting news, we have published the website to github pages, which you can check here.

If you have any concerns feel free to contact us at your earliest convenience.
