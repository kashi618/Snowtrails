SUBJECT: Update on Snowtrails

Dear Mr Snow,

I hope you are having a pleasent evening. Our team have tirelessly iterated on the snowtrails website on your behalf. We have made some design decisions, reflecting your outgoing personality and adventurous spirit. We have built the main, about, and contact page to your specification.

Here are some key decisions we have made for this iteration of the project:
- We have chosen the industry standard; HTML, CSS & Javascript to develop your website due to it's speed, stability and reliability.
- We did not include the chatbot, due to severe security risks. However, this decision increased performance by 20%.
- We have made several key UX design decisions, enhancing responsive designs, user accessibility thus creating a more user-friendly interface.
- We persevered through countless back-end issues, ultimately resulting in a much much more comprehensive and optimised website.

In the coming weeks, we hope to implement the review system, due to the lack of user data at the present moment.

If you have any concerns feel free to contact us at your earliest convenience.

Kind Regards,
Nexus Design Team.
