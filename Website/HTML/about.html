                    <p>Hello, my name is Lucas Snow and I am the person behind Snowtrails. <br><br> Despite being blind, I’ve always
                        felt a deep connection to the snow-covered mountains and the thrill of exploring their vast, frozen landscapes. Hiking through alpine
                        trails has become one of my greatest joys, and I rely on my other senses to fully immerse myself in the environment—the crisp mountain air,
                        the crunch of snow beneath my boots, and the sound of the wind through the trees. Snow sports like skiing and snowboarding give me a sense of 
                        freedom and excitement that I can’t find anywhere else. For me, it’s not about seeing the mountains; it’s about feeling them, experiencing their 
                        beauty with every step and every movement.<br>With my intense love for the alps I thought of sharing my passion with others. In my pursuit of this
                        me and my team have set up this website to let others be able to experience the joys of snowy mountains easier with less hassle.

                <h1>Winter Sports</h1>
                <hr><br>
                <p>I highly recommend trying snow sports if you haven’t yet—there's truly nothing like the rush of carving through fresh powder. Whether it's skiing, snowboarding, or even snowshoeing, the combination of adrenaline and the stunning alpine scenery is unmatched. The crisp mountain air, the feeling of speed as you glide down the slopes, and the peaceful moments when you're deep in the backcountry are all experiences that stay with you long after the trip. Plus, snow sports are a fantastic way to challenge yourself, improve your fitness, and bond with friends or family. It’s an adventure that keeps you coming back for more every winter.</p>

            <h1>Skateboarding Blind</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>As a blind person, I can tell you that blind people can be incredible at skateboarding, and it's all about adapting to our unique strengths. We might not rely on sight, but we have a deep awareness of our bodies and the environment. We feel the board under our feet and use the vibrations and sounds around us to understand how we’re moving. The sound of the wheels on different surfaces, the feel of the air, and the rhythm of the board all provide important feedback that guides us. With practice and the right support, blind skateboarders can develop a strong sense of balance and timing. It's not about what we can't see—it’s about what we can feel, hear, and trust in ourselves. It’s amazing to see how determination and creativity can turn skateboarding into an accessible and thrilling experience.</p>
